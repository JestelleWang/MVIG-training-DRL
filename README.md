# MVIG-training-DRL
This is the second section of MVIG training.

The `DeepReinforcementLearning.md` file is just a draft of my final paper. And the `TD Learning.md` file is my notes when learning that theories. Both files are incompleted. Please ignore it.

My paper is in `paper/latex` folder, where `.tex` and compiled `.pdf` file are exist. My code is in `Atari.ipynb`, which is also my notes when learning DRL.

Because of some external contents, the documents I have written this time is not as good as last time. It's my fault and I have to say sorry for it.
